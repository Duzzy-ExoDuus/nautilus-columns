# nautilus-columns

If your music files aren't named properly or simply want to see the MP3 and FLAC metadata information (ID3 tags) in Nautilus List View, you can't by default.

But I found a python script (which also comes as a .deb file) on the Ubuntu Forums called "Nautilus Columns" which adds new columns to Nautilus, so you can view such metadata information. Besides MP3 and FLAC, the script was also updated to support JPEG EXIF shooting data.
